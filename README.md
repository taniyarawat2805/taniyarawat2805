Initialization: The library provides functions to initialize linkedlist.h , which can be done from strings, integers, or other big integers.

Addition and Subtraction:

Addition: linkedlist.h supports addition of two big integers, returning the result as a new big integer. Subtraction: You can subtract one big integer from another, preserving precision. Multiplication and Division:

Multiplication: linkedlist.h enables the multiplication of two big integers, providing the product as a new big integer. Division: It supports division of one big integer by another, offering both the quotient and remainder as big integers. Comparison: You can compare two big integers for equality, greater-than, or less-than relationships.

Conversion: linkedlist.h allows for conversion between big integers and other data types (e.g., to/from strings).

Error Handling: The library includes error-handling mechanisms to deal with cases like division by zero or memory allocation failures.
